Do other people have conversations with their managers about how to have
healthier relationships with tools like Slack, or is it just me? It
can’t just be me. I’ve been thinking for a while about what frustrates
me most about Slack and similar systems, and after more than a year of
full-time use, I have some thoughts.

First, you are locked in to their client. Why can't I use Pidgin or
irssi, without jumping through hoops -- and even then half the features
don't work.

There’s the oft-complained about @here and @channel, for which you can
only turn off notifications per-channel. Usually people forget, and in
large public channels you see a flurry of departures after someone uses
one of those wide-distribution aliases for the first time.

[Naked pings](https://blogs.gnome.org/markmc/2014/02/20/naked-pings/) or
[just saying hello](https://www.nohello.com/) are disruptive as well.
Then, there’s behavior like looping others into threads that are
hundreds of messages long, with a simple “cc” or “FYI”.  I’m calling
those “naked FYI’s.”

But those are just individual annoyances: there’s something more
sinister about the premise of the entire product –  maybe intentional or not –
that is harmful to individuals. One of the design decisions of Slack is
that your user is always just there – waiting to get a message, or
magicked into a new channel with a simple ping. You can never just not
be there.

Did you ever use [AOL Instant
Messenger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIM_(software)? Offline
messages were not possible for many years. You’d long to hear the sound
of a favorite person signed on and was open to get messages. Not with
Slack.

Have a co-worker in a different time zone? You can send a message at 3:00
a.m..  She can have her status as away, or do not disturb, but her
digital presence is still there. Slack helpfully sends her an e-mail
with just a snippet of the conversation – just enough to get their
attention.  Maybe she sees it on her phone while eating breakfast, and
Slack helpfully refers her to install their app.

Yes, the mobile access is convenient. I can take off to a doctor’s
appointment and still talk to a coworker about an on-going issue.
That’s not the only time I use it, though. I open it before bed. I have
a look at dinner. In this day and age, we are used to instant
gratification, we like to get it ourselves so we want to give it back,
too.

Not to mention the fear of missing out.  You’re on holiday? What
important discussions are you missing on Slack while you’re sitting on
the beach? Well, thankfully you can just pop in for a second to check it
out since you have the mobile app!

People have a responsibility to use tools appropriately, and manage
their work-life balance, but at a certain point the evidence is so
overwhelming the system is designed to be used irresponsibly that you
just need to reconsider it’s use.

People complain about IRC – clunky CLI clients and it's ephemeral nature, but
the latter is a part of why it's such a right-sized tool. It’s temporary
nature drives longer form discussions to different places. Fear of missing
out is diminished when there's not an expectation to read back history. The lack
of threads encourages summaries when reaching out to include someone
else in a discussion.

The problem, of course, is that Slack is here to stay. What do you all
do to have a healthier relationship with it?
